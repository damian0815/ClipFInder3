def minimum_cost_path_coverage(distance_matrix: torch.Tensor) -> List[int]:
    """
    Find K non-intersecting paths that together cover all nodes with minimum total cost.

    This is a greedy approximation algorithm that builds paths by:
    1. Sorting all edges by distance (shortest first)
    2. Greedily adding edges that connect unvisited nodes or extend existing paths
    3. Adding any remaining isolated nodes at the end

    This approach is much faster than TSP (O(nÂ²log n) vs O(n!)) while still
    creating semantically coherent orderings for browsing.

    Args:
        distance_matrix: Square symmetric matrix of distances between nodes
        num_paths: Target number of paths. If None, will be determined automatically

    Returns:
        List of node indices in the order they should be visited
